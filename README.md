# General info
Welcome to the Computer Vision Lightroom plugin project page. This project aims to provide a Lightroom plugin that lets you submit photos to the various compouter vision platforms. The idea is to leverage AI to help improve photo tagging.

# Compatibility
- Lightroom 5 and higher
- Windows 10 (lower versions of Windows likely work but are untested, please let me know if you have success with other versions of Windows)
- Mac is untested but will likely work, please let me know if it works on a Mac

# Install
See the "INSTALL.md" file for install instructions

# Usage

# Pro Tips
## Tagging Window Preferences
If you have a 1080p monitor, the following values work great for the tagging window and thumbnail sizes:

- Thumbnail size: 256
- Tagging Window Width: 1850
- Tagging Window Height: 875
