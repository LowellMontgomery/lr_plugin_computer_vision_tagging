# General info
Welcome to the Computer Vision Lightroom plugin project page. This project aims to provide a Lightroom plugin that lets you submit photos to the Clarifai and Google Vision platforms. The idea is to leverage AI to help improve photo tagging.

# Compatibility
- Lightroom 5.0
- Windows (Mac untested)

# Pro Tips

- Thumbnail size: 256
- Tagging Window Width: 1850
- Tagging Window Height: 875
